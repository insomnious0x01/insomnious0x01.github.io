					<h2>How to bypass Threat Manager&#039;s IP blacklisting</h2>
					<p class="published">Published on 04/08/2018</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.alertlogic.com/solutions/network-intrusion-detection-system-ids/">Threat Manager</a> is an Intrusion Detection System created by <a href="https://www.alertlogic.com/">Alert Logic</a>. Alert Logic likes to partner up with hosting companies who are responsible for installation and maintenance of these appliances.</p>
					<h3>How I found it</h3>
					<p>I was reviewing Threat Manager's incident logs and I stumbled across a couple of logs where attackers were bypassing Threat Manager's IP blacklisting.</p>
					<p>I gathered the payloads, analysed them and tested this bypass to confirm if it works - and it did. My IP address wasn't blacklisted by the IDS, which means I was able to continue attacking the target. To my knowledge the IDS was fully up to date and there were no pending updates.</p>
					<h3>How to use it</h3>
					<p>To avoid getting yourself blacklisted by the Threat Manager, you need to pass two extra HTTP headers with your request, <code>X-Real-IP</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>, and set both of them to any IP address you like. Presence of these two HTTP headers will trick the IDS to treating you like a proxy server, so instead of blacklisting your IP address, it will blacklist an IP address that you supply in these two HTTP headers!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this is Threat Manager's <em>default</em> behaviour!</p>
</blockquote>
					<p>This is how the IP addresses will appear on the incident log:</p>
<pre><code>ID: &lt;incident ID here&gt;
Source: x.x.x.x (IP address from X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-For headers)
Destination: x.x.x.x (the target's private IP address, e.g. a web server)
Proxy: x.x.x.x (attacker's public IP address)</code></pre>
					<h3>How to fix it</h3>
					<p>You can fix this behaviour by changing Threat Manager's settings to ignore the HTTP headers and blacklist attacker's public IP address. I was told by the hosting company's Network Security Engineer that &quot;there is a chance of blocking all requests that may be using a legitimate proxy, such as CDN. Most customers block based on the HTTP header, but you will have to decide what works best for your environment&quot;.</p>
					<h3>Does it work anywhere else?</h3>
					<p>I'd be interested to know how other IDS providers, commercial or open source, behave when <code>X-Real-IP</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> headers are passed through with a request. If you know, please let me know via <a href="https://twitter.com/insomnious0x01">Twitter</a>.</p>
